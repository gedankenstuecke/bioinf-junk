Contents:
* misa -> Wrapper that uses misa to detect SSRs and gives back tab-delimited file with original-sequence
* utr_filter.py -> split a fasta-file into 2, one with all CDSs and one with all UTRs. Needs ORFPREDICTOR-Input
* radtag_finder.py -> Find all restriction-enzyme-sites in all sequences of a fasta-file
* snp_finder.py -> Find all SNPs in a BAM/SAM-File. SNPs are defined by minimum read depth of the alignment and the minimum allele frequency
* snp_utr_filter.py -> Bin SNPs to UTR/CDS-bins
* xml_blast_extractor.py -> parses blast-xml-output (useful if you want to use blast2go) and gives back a tab-delimited file incl. most important information about hits. use an evalue-cutoff to filter the hits
* readfilterfiter.py -> filter a huge fasta-file using sequence-identifiers to get rid of unwanted entries
* gofinder.py -> enhance cli-output of blast2go with more information about go-hits
* genreconstruction.py -> let's not talk about this one...
